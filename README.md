# Python
Welcome to My Python Repository! Here you'll find:
- Some notes about learning;
- Exercises and their answers;
- etc;

All these folders and files are based in [FreeCodeCamp Course of Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/), so, visit there to have more content, like videos and files. Don't worry, this is totally **free**!!!
The my repository is just somethings (codes, notes, etc) that i did during the course. You can use them as you want.
