# Database Studies

Welcome to my database studies repository! This is where I organize and document my journey in learning and exploring the world of databases.

These files and folders came from [FreeCodeCamp Course about scientific computing with python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/). This course is totally free.

The principal file, the file with my own codes, is SqLite.py. The files that starts with *test* are just a starting in databases' world and the *LMS* are about **Learning Management System**, i.e., techniques to increase velocity to the database, like databases design, one-to-many or many-to-many relathionships, etc.

The folders *geodata* and *pagerank* are made by [dr. Charles Severance](https://www.dr-chuck.com/)https://www.dr-chuck.com/), the teacher of the course.

You can use all the files as you want. They don't have special license.
